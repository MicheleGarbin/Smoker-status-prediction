# Project Overview

This project was carried out in collaboration with my colleagues [@Del√¨ Lin](https://github.com/lindeli31) and [@colleague2](https://github.com/colleague2).

The goal of the project was to solve a classification problem: predicting smoker status based on biological variables.

## File structure

- The R scripts and code are located in the `source` folder.
- The `report` folder contains the LaTeX source files compressed in a `.zip` archive, as well as the compiled PDF report, which you can download directly.

Feel free to explore the code and the report for more details!
