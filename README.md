# Project Overview

This project was carried out in collaboration with my colleagues [@Del√¨ Lin](https://github.com/lindeli31) and [@Riccardo Santi](https://github.com/santiric).

The goal of the project was to solve a classification problem: predicting smoker status based on biological variables.

The statistical methods and models used to address this problem are:
- logistic regression with stepwise variable selection
- logistic regression with ridge and lasso penalization
- linear discriminant analysis
- quadratic discriminant analysis
- classification tree
- random forest

## File structure

- The R scripts and code are located in the `source` folder.
- The `images` folder contains all the plots and visualizations generated by the R scripts during the analysis.
- The `report` folder contains the LaTeX source files compressed in a `.zip` archive, as well as the compiled PDF report, which you can download by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicheleGarbin/Smoker-status-prediction/main/report/Smoker_status_prediction.pdf).
- The `data` folder contains the dataset we worked on during this project. The data is publicly available at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction-using-biosignals?select=train_dataset.csv).

Feel free to explore the code and the report for more details!
